> Lone dweller on the shores of the ruthless sea that goes by name 'Life', I am trying to catch all what is there to it, while the blood that circulates in my veins lets me breathe and holds my spirit. 

Hi there. I am in Love with many Technologies I caught present here when I entered the field. To Encodings of Thought - whether it is Natural or Synthetic, Navajo or Maude - I feel Amusement and Love; To Formalisms - whether they say about Nutaral Phenomena, or broadcast cues about Abstractions - I hold obeisance and indebtedness. To fellow human beings - whether they can reach afflatus and go beyond, or keep the duty - I feel devoir.

Lately, I have been reading about Type Systems, Higher-Order Logic, Topological Structures, Artificial and Biological Neural Networks, Language Processing, Expressive Power of Formal Systems, and many other related and irrelevant topics and found very many connections that reveal big beautiful landscape of similarities. I think I have some Insights to share.

Through my journey of becoming a programmer, I encountered many languages and acquired varying degrees of proficiency. Bellow, is the table of my judgements about them:


|||
|:-|:-|
|Haskell|Composition derrived from the categorical framework have profound effect on reuse and interaction with software artifacts. Absence of mutable state implies some limitations|
|Pony|Control of mutability is as important as writing an implementation free of bugs. It is in fact synonymous - if you want to not have errors in programm, control of mutable state must be used explicitly|
|Rust|Various level of control such that it is possible to fizzle out most of machine power for every single byte without shooting you legs off; at least often|
|Scala|To be able to use big collection of various libraries to make ideas come true in least time is a precious feature. JVM platform provides that. And, whilst not without troubles, Scala does provide certain functionality of type system that is absent in other languages of common use|

Currently I am digging into public Research to satisfy my last of perfection by atempt to make a language for 21st century.
I know for certain that it should be based on multiple ideas concieved at various frontier domains of computer science, among which are Ambients, Modalities, Dynamism, Build Systems, Runtime Models, Artifact Distribution, Metaprogramming and probably some other awaiting in the dark at the moment. Check out my gists.
